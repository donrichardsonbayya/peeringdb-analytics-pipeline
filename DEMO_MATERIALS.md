## üìä **Demo Script**

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**
"This is my PeeringDB Analytics Pipeline project. It's a complete data engineering solution that processes infrastructure data to provide business insights."

### **Architecture Walkthrough (1 minute)**
"Here's the architecture: PeeringDB API feeds into Airflow for orchestration, PostgreSQL for storage, dbt for transformation, and PowerBI for visualization."

### **Technical Demo (2 minutes)**
"Let me show you the key components:
1. Docker containers running the entire stack
2. Airflow DAGs automating data ingestion
3. dbt models transforming raw data
4. PowerBI dashboards providing insights"

### **Business Value (1 minute)**
"The dashboards reveal critical insights: 91% facility underutilization, 94% IX underutilization, and US market concentration - all actionable business intelligence."

## üé¨ **Video Demo Script**

### **Opening (15 seconds)**
"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I want to show you my PeeringDB Analytics Pipeline - a complete data engineering project that demonstrates modern data stack proficiency."

### **Architecture (30 seconds)**
"This project uses Apache Airflow for orchestration, PostgreSQL for storage, dbt for transformation, and PowerBI for visualization. Everything runs in Docker containers for scalability."

### **Live Demo (2 minutes)**
"Let me show you it in action:
1. Here are the Docker containers running
2. This is the Airflow UI showing automated DAGs
3. Here's the dbt transformation output
4. And these are the PowerBI dashboards with real insights"

### **Business Impact (30 seconds)**
"The dashboards reveal that 91% of facilities are underutilized, 94% of Internet Exchanges are inactive, and all active infrastructure is concentrated in the US - providing clear strategic direction."

### **Closing (15 seconds)**
"This project demonstrates end-to-end data engineering skills and delivers real business value. Check out the GitHub repository for the complete implementation!"
